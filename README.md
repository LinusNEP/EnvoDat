# EnvoDat dataset
<b>Official development and benchmarking kit for EnvoDat.</b> To replicate all the results in our [official project website](https://linusnep.github.io/EnvoDat/), we strongly recommend using this repository to run our pre-trained models, train on custom datasets, run inferences on the models and perform benchmark evaluation of the SoTA SLAM algorithms.
